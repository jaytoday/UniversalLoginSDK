# Ethereum Universal Login

Universal Login is a tool for storing funds and connecting to Ethereum applications, aiming to simplify on-boarding of new users.

This repository is a monorepo including the sdk, relayer, smart contracts and examples. Each public sub-package is independently published to NPM.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. Expect breaking changes. The code has not been audited and therefore can not be considered secure.

## Technical concepts
Technically Universal Login utilizes four major concepts:
- Personal multi-sig wallet - a smart contract used to store personal funds. A user gets his wallet created in a barely noticeable manner. The user then incrementally adds authorization factors and recovery options.
- Meta-transactions - these give users the ability to interact with their wallets from multiple devices easily, without a need to store ether on each of those devices. Meta-transactions, also allow one to pay for execution with tokens.
- ENS names - naming your wallet with easy-to-remember human-readable names.
- Universal login - ability to use the wallet as an authorization layer to numerous web applications/dapps.

## Structure
Packages maintained with this monorepo are listed below.

- [Contracts](https://github.com/UniversalLogin/UniversalLoginSDK/tree/master/universal-login-contracts) - all contracts used in this project
- Relayer - node.js server application that allows interacting with blockchain without a wallet
- SDK - a JS library, that helps to communicate with relayer
- OPS - scripts for development and deployment
- React - library of React components
- Web3 - web3 provider connected allowing to use Universal Login without the need for modifying existing applications
- Wallet - Jarvis web wallet that used Universal Login
- Commons - standard functions and data structures used throughout the projects
